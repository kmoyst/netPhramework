    <h1>Welcome to your new netPhramework Website!</h1>
<p class="getting-started">To get started, follow this guide.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create a lib directory parallel to your web directory (i.e. ../lib).
        This is what the Loader searches first by default.
        Create a directory for the namespace of your application in your lib
        directory. This is so your not colliding with root namespace classes.
        A .php extension is expected by the Loader. PascalCase is recommended
        for the class names and camelCase for namespaces.
        File name should be the same as the class name with .php extension.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a html directory parallel to your web directory (i.e. ../html).
        That's what the template finder searches first by default.
        A .phtml extension is searched for by default. The Leaf abstract class
        converts kebab-case to guess the Leaf name if none is provided in
        the constructor.
    </li>
	<li>
		Subclass netPhramework\bootstrap\Configuration and place in your lib
        directory. Override the methods as needed to configure your Application.
        You can create multiple configurations.
	</li>
    <li>
        There is a netPhramework\db\configuration\AdminConfiguration that
        indexes all the tables in the database with basic CRUD processes. It
        can be subclassed, if needed. Definitely ONLY for administrators.
    </li>
	<li>
		Subclass netPhramework\bootstrap\SiteContext and override
		the getConfiguration() method.
        You can use a conditional in getConfiguration() to choose between
        Configurations if you made more than one. You can use the parent class
        protected property $session (or just use the public getSession() method)
        in SiteContext to determine if a user is logged in.
    </li>
	<li>
		Modify index.php in your web directory to provide your new SiteContext
		subclass instead of the default in netPhramework\bootstrap. You can
        also inject a different Environment (enum) into the SiteContext
        constructor. SiteContext defaults to Environment::PRODUCTION if this
        is not injected on instantiation.
	</li>
    <li>
        You have to examine the netPhramework code to understand how to use
        it. The code is self documenting and designed to be lean enough
        to examine. There are intelligent defaults that can make some
        assumptions, especially when gathering information from the database.
        These can almost always be overriden through injection of a subclass.
    </li>
    <li>
        It should be unnecessary to alter the netPhramework code. Extending
        classes and implementing interfaces should always provide
        the desired results.
    </li>
    <li>
        A word on form validation. This should be done at the Component level.
        i.e. it should be done in the Leafs and Processes. The data abstraction
        level (i.e. Field validators) are meant to validate data based on
        what the database itself allows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have fun!
    </li>
